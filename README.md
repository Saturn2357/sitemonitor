# sitemonitor

I accepted Jimmy's change since it made it so that the program was able to get the html string before it entered the loop; more pythonic that way I guess.

I would have accepted David's changes but there was an annoying error that Gitbud kept having. So I accepted the changes in my mind. The reason why I accepted the changes was because it allowed the program to get any link the user requested.
